# NOTES
README FILE
The purpose of this app is to serve as a user login and payment service for my project, Beetcode, which is a google chrome extension that helps with SWE interview preparation: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/beetcode/efiojecmnbhdecicbfnejfnegennfhlf

I used firebase authentication for users to be able to create an account with gmail or with any other email. If the user is already registered, I throw an error. The password length also must be longer than 6 characters. To complete that task, I watched a YouTube tutorial but I added onto it by verifying that the user wasn't already in the firebase database.

Then, I tried to implement a PayPal functionality, but I ran out of time (you can see my code comments for proof). I did a mock financial services program where a user can type in the cost of the subscription ($4.99) and thatâ€™s sent to the backend. If the user pays the correct amount, I send back success. If not, I report failure. All user submitted info is sent to MongoDB so I can keep up with sales transactions.

The primary code files I wrote are main.js in my backend and TextInput in src/components/home/ . 

In TextInput, I used conditional rendering, useState hooks and a form for a simple frontend layout.

the rest of the code I used online tutorials and google firebase documentation to help me deploy.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
